	  <p class = "box1">Well, this is one of my best experiments with postal colours. The objective of the painting was to potray 'PERMANENCE', and in my opinion there's no match for the permanence of nature. I have tried to display bad, stormy weather. But a tree can even withstand such a cruel weather with all its glory remaining indifferent.</p>

	<p class = "box4">Krishna: I made this oil painting in 10th standard and I consider it to be the best work done by me till date. The painting consists of lot of colours, which is actually the essence of the painting. No offence to anybody, but I ain't a strict believer of any religion and thus in my opinion this painting has less to do the with cultural beliefs, it shows how colourful our life is, different colours even for similar parts like hands shows the diversity of the life and.......</p>
