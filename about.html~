      <p class = "textt2">The first year, here at IIIT is enough to disconnect you from all your hobbies and activities but despite the fact, I'll try hard to preserve mine(:P). Most of my interest lies in sports. I can play anytime and everytime. I have been into badmintion for the past 4-5 years (played regional level tournaments and CBSE North Zone) and I hope to expand that period for atleast the next few years (Define 'few' for yourself). I love playing other games to, Cricket and Volleyball being among them. Lately, after coming here at IIIT, I have found 'software' an interesting thing. I'd love to play around with it.</p>
